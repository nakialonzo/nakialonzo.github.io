     <h2>How do people get it?</h2>
     <p>People can recieve this deadly drug from their friends and family members, as well as many unknown strangers who are just known to sell drugs on the streets. There are also tons of shipments coming in from the borderline of Mexico including many other places worldwide. Kids and adults can actually digest this harmful drug in foods such as desserts like brownies, cookies, or in other words you could basically say anything you'd like.</p>

    <h2>Dangers of it?</h2>

    <h2>Who is harmed by it?</h2>
    <p>Many kids and adults are harmed by this product, some babies are included! Babies can be harmed when in the womb due to mothers using any type of drug. When the drug is being used they put themselves and the baby in danger. Leaving a remainder of the drug in  babies reach is also putting them in danger because there is a chance of them digesting it. Children's brains are not yet developed to withstand the harmful chemicals within the marijuana. Adults will also face side effects after using the product, such as; nausea, severe anxiety, short-term memory loss, lowered reaction time (slow at reacting), strange behaviour (seeing/smelling things that aren't there), increased heart rate (risk of heart attack as well as getting a heart stroke), etc. Teenagers are also less likely to graduate due to taking marijuana before their classes.</p>

    <h2>Consequences of sellling it? (What if you get caught using it?)</h2>
    <p>Some of the consequences of using the drug it self is: nausea, severe anxiety, short-term memory loss, lowered reaction time (slower at reacting to things), strange behaviours (such as seeing and smelling things that aren't there), increased heart rate (risk of heart attack including a heart stroke), etc. Although marijauna is now legal, it depends on how you use it! So you still have a slight chance of going to jail.</P>
